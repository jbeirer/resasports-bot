Welcome to pysportbot!

## Download pysportbot
```python
pip install pysportbot
```

## Quick Start

```python
from pysportbot import SportBot

# Create bot instance, will list available centres if requested
bot = SportBot(log_level='INFO', print_centres=False, time_zone = 'Europe/Madrid')

# Connect to service with email and password as well as the name of the centre
bot.login('email', 'password', 'centre')

# List available activites
bot.activities(limit = 10)

# List bookable slots for an activity on a specific day
bot.daily_slots(activity='YourFavouriteGymClass', day = '2025-01-03', limit = 10)

# Book an activity slot on a specific day and time
bot.book(activity='YourFavouriteGymClass', start_time = '2024-12-30 07:00:00')

# Cancel an activity slot on a specific day and time
bot.cancel(activity='YourFavouriteGymClass', start_time = '2024-12-30 07:00:00')
```

## Advanced usage as service

You can easily run `pysportbot` as a service to manage your bookings automatically with
```bash
python -m pysportbot.service --config config.json
```
The service requires a `json` configuration file that specifies your user data and how you would like to book your classes. Currently, three types of configuration are supported:

##### 1. Book an upcoming class now

Let's say you would like to book Yoga next Monday at 18:00:00, then your `config.json` would look like:

```json
{
    "email": "your-email",
    "password": "your-password",
    "center": "your-gym-name",
    "classes": [
        {
            "activity": "Yoga",
            "class_day": "Monday",
            "class_time": "18:00:00",
            "booking_execution": "now",
            "weekly": false
        }
    ]
}
```
##### 2. Book an upcoming class on a specific day and time

Let's say you would like to book Yoga next Monday at 18:00:00, but the execution of the booking should only happen on Friday at 07:30:00 then your `config.json` would look like:

```json
{
    "email": "your-email",
    "password": "your-password",
    "center": "your-gym-name",
    "classes": [
        {
            "activity": "Yoga",
            "class_day": "Monday",
            "class_time": "18:00:00",
            "booking_execution": "Friday 07:30:00",
            "weekly": false
        }
    ]
}
```
##### 3. Schedule weekly booking at specific execution day and time
Let's say you would like to book Yoga every Monday at 18:00:00 and the booking execution should be every Friday at 07:30:00 then your `config.json` would look like:

```json
{
    "email": "your-email",
    "password": "your-password",
    "center": "your-gym-name",
    "classes": [
        {
            "activity": "Yoga",
            "class_day": "Monday",
            "class_time": "18:00:00",
            "booking_execution": "Friday 07:30:00",
            "weekly": true
        }
    ]
}
```

The service also provides various other options that can be inspected with

```bash
python -m pysportbot.service --help
```
Currently supported options include
1.  ```--retry-attempts``` sets the number of retries attempted in case a booking attempt fails
2. ```--retry-delay-minutes``` sets the delay in minutes between retries for weekly bookings
3. ```--time-zone``` sets the time zone for the service (e.g. Europe/Madrid)
4. ```--log-level``` sets the log-level of the service (e.g. DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
